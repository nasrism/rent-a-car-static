We&#8217;re thrilled to have you here, and we want to make your car rental experience as smooth as possible. Below are some common questions and answers to help you get started:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. How old do I need to be to rent a car?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>In most locations, you need to be at least 21 years old to rent a car. However, the minimum age requirement may vary by location, and drivers under 25 may be subject to a young driver surcharge.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. What documents do I need to rent a car?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>You typically need a valid driver&#8217;s license, a major credit card in your name, and proof of insurance. International renters may need additional documents like a passport and an international driver&#8217;s permit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Can I rent a car without a credit card?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>We require a credit card for the reservation and rental payment process. However, some locations may accept debit cards with certain restrictions and additional verification.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. How is the rental rate calculated?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rental rates are usually calculated based on the type of car, the duration of the rental, and any additional services or coverage you choose. It&#8217;s best to check our website or contact our customer service for specific pricing details.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Can I modify or cancel my reservation?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Yes, you can typically modify or cancel your reservation online or by contacting our customer service. Keep in mind that there may be cancellation fees, and the rules vary depending on the location and rental terms.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Do you offer additional coverage options?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Yes, we offer additional coverage options like collision damage waiver (CDW), personal accident insurance (PAI), and supplementary liability insurance (SLI). These options provide added protection in case of accidents or damage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. Can I add an additional driver to the rental agreement?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Yes, you can usually add an additional driver to the rental agreement for a fee, provided they meet the age and licensing requirements.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>8. What is the fuel policy for the rental car?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Our standard policy is to provide you with a full tank of fuel, and you&#8217;re expected to return the car with a full tank. Alternatively, you can prepay for fuel at a competitive rate and return the car with any fuel level.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>9. Are there any mileage restrictions?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Most rentals come with unlimited mileage within the country or state of rental. However, if you plan to travel across borders, there may be restrictions, so it&#8217;s essential to check in advance.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>10. How do I contact roadside assistance in case of a breakdown?<\/strong><br>&#8211; Our rental cars come with 24\/7 roadside assistance. The contact information for assistance is provided in your rental agreement and should be in the car&#8217;s glove compartment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>11. Can I return the car to a different location?<\/strong><br>&#8211; Yes, we offer one-way rentals that allow you to pick up the car at one location and return it to another. Additional fees may apply, depending on the distance between locations.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) &#8211; Rent-A-Car Welcome to Rent-A-Car!
